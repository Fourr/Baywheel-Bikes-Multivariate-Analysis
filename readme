1.) I chose the Baywheels data set
2.) 
	A.)"Summary Of Findings":
		- My main point is that the longer and farther rides are ridden by electric riders. I put the plot that compared distance/time for different rideable types which is how I came to that conclusion. Another conclusion I came 		  to is that there is a linear relationship between ride time and distance traveled. 
	B.) "Key insights":
		- Plotting the Distance vs the Ride Time produces a linear relationship. The majority of riders are within a 30 minute bike ride within a 3 mile trip.
		- When comparing distance to time ridden, it is clear that there are spikes near the .5 mile mark and the .8 mile mark.
		- Ride time has a long-tailed distribution, with most ride times being on lower end and few ride times on the higher end. When plotted on a log-scale, the ride time distribution looks unimodal that is slightly skewed right. There is a peak around 8-10 minute mark with outliers near the 18-20 minute mark and again at around 26-28 minute mark.

There are a lot more spikes, the .5 mile mark, the ~.65 mile mark, and the .85 mile mark.
